# Music-Scale-Generator-Python
Python program for generating music scales to practice


Context: I decided I wanted to get this idea off the ground as a mobile app. Python sounded cool, seemed easy to learn for beginning coders, and was already used successfully for social media apps and even AI. 
Action: I found out about Udemy and purchased about $100 worth of courses during their Black Friday sale and started learning about Python, Django, HTML, and CSS.
Result: When I completed the code for the first draft about a year later, it felt amazing! I think the entire code was around 800 lines long and I felt very proud of my work.
Reflection: I learned a bit more and worked the code down to a few hundred lines and felt a bit silly. But Iâ€™m still very proud of my roots, and juggling a full-time day job, a growing family, and following my plan of getting this done!
